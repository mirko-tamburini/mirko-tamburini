## Hi there, I'm Mirko Tamburini ðŸ‘‹

I am a Theoretical Physicist with an MSc from UniversitÃ  di Pisa (Italy), specializing in:
- Quantum Chromodynamics & Non-Perturbative Aspects of Gauge Theories
- Lattice Gauge Theories & Chiral Effective Lagrangian models
- Quantum Phase Transition and Statistical Mechanics

I'm currently looking for a PhD in Theoretical Physics and I'm interested in Fundamental 
Interactions in High-Energy Physics and computational approaches in quantum field theory.
